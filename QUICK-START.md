# ðŸš€ Family Hub - Quick Start with Supabase Pro

## Current Status: MCP Configured âœ…

Your Supabase Personal Access Token is configured and ready for MCP automation.

## Step 1: Create Supabase Projects (2 minutes)

Since you have a **Pro account**, create these projects with enhanced features:

### **Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and create:**

```bash
Project 1: family-hub-dev
- Plan: Pro (for enhanced features)
- Region: [Choose closest to you]
- Database Password: [Generate strong - SAVE IT!]

Project 2: family-hub-staging  
- Plan: Pro 
- Region: [Same as dev]
- Database Password: [Generate strong - SAVE IT!]

Project 3: family-hub-prod
- Plan: Pro
- Region: [Same as dev] 
- Database Password: [Generate strong - SAVE IT!]
```

## Step 2: Get Project Credentials

**For each project, go to Settings > API and copy:**

### Development Project:
```
Project URL: https://[dev-id].supabase.co
anon key: eyJ...
service_role key: eyJ...
```

### Staging Project:
```
Project URL: https://[staging-id].supabase.co

service_role key: eyJ...
```

### Production Project:
